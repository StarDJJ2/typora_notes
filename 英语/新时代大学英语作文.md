# 6.Gender Bias in Job Market

## 要求：

Your essay should include the following parts:

1. Introduction the Phenomenon & your thesis
2. Analysis of the phenomenon (including both causes and effects of the problem)
3. Conclusion

## 正文

​		Gender bias exists in the job market, which makes us uneasy. Although we have made some progress, women still face many difficulties and inequalities. 

​		Firstly, gender bias manifests as a questioning of or <font color='red'>disdain</font> for women's abilities. Even if women have excellent performance at work, they may still be seen as more emotional or lacking in leadership compared to men. These ideas <font color='red'>stem from</font> fixed impressions of gender roles in society, which highlight male leadership and competitiveness while considering women as weaker and more suitable for <font color='red'>auxiliary</font> work. 

​		Secondly, gender bias also manifests as obstacles to women's advancement in the workplace. Women often face higher promotion standards than men and find it difficult to obtain equal opportunities and treatment in highly competitive workplaces. The source of this bias lies in the fact that many organizations are still male-dominated, and they tend to recruit and promote people similar to themselves. 

​		Gender bias has many negative effects on individuals and organizations. For women who are suspected and discriminated against, they may feel frustrated and unfair, and even give up pursuing their career goals. For organizations, ignoring potential talented women may also lead to business losses and increased <font color='red'>employee turnover rates</font>. 

​		On this issue, we need to take measures to eliminate gender bias. This includes strengthening education and awareness to make people aware of the seriousness of gender discrimination and take action. In addition, organizations need to review their recruitment and promotion policies and take measures to ensure that the most qualified candidates are selected rather than simply because they are similar to the existing management. 

​		In conclusion, gender bias is a complex issue that requires our <font color='red'>joint</font> efforts to solve. Only through cooperation and action can we achieve gender equality and workplace fairness.
